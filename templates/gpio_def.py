GPIO Pin Definitions
This file contains the GPIO pin numbers for the Teensy board and strobe control pins on the Pi
- When setting up a new vehicle, do not directly edit the file in 'templates'; rather the copied file generated by 'setup.sh' in 'config'
- If you edit this file, you'll need to make sure the copied file in 'config' is updated as well
