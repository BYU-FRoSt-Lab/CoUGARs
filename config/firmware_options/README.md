**NOTE: Do not directly add custom files to the directory in ~/CougarsSetup/config; rather edit the copied directory in ~/config**
Custom hex files added here can be uploaded to either Teensy using the "upload_control.sh" and "upload_sensors.sh" scripts located in ~/teensy_ws (inside the Docker container).
