This repo contains the basic files and scripts necessary to set up a new Coug-UV in the BYU FRoSt lab's **Cooperative Underwater Group of Autonomous Robots (CoUGARs)**. 
After flashing a new RPi 5, simply log into it over ssh, clone this repository, and run "setup.sh".
You should then be able to spin up the latest Docker image as a container using "compose.sh".

If you're looking to do remote development on the Coug-UV, check out these repos instead: https://github.com/BYU-FRoSt-Lab/cougars-ros2.git, https://github.com/BYU-FRoSt-Lab/cougars-teensy.git, https://github.com/BYU-FRoSt-Lab/cougars-gpio.git
